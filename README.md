To view the backend: https://github.com/joshuamsmith413/menew_backend

Menew is an app designed to help restaurant employees stay up to date with the current menus of the restaurant they work at.

The idea is that a restaurant would enter in all of the information on each item and then the employee would be able to study in a better way than reading word documents.

From the backend file above run bundle followed by rails s to get the localhost:3001 server up

From this file run npm install followed by npm start and then yes to view client
